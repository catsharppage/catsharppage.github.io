					<p>Catherine “Cat” Sharp is a lifelong Chicagoan and proud public servant running to serve the 12th District of Cook County. As the Chief of Staff of the 40th Ward, she manages a team of seven to deliver City services for the ward’s 57,000+ residents. With a genuine passion for service and wealth of experience at the City and County, Cat is dedicated to making the 12th District a safe and vibrant place.</p>
					<p>During her tenure as Chief of Staff, Cat has helped ensure the 40th Ward has brought in tens of millions of dollars of investments in the 40th Ward for infrastructure, park, school, public safety, and small business improvement projects.</p>
					<p>As the public safety liaison of the 40th Ward, Cat has worked with local police commanders and captains to share public safety notifications with neighbors, assisting in investigation efforts by locating additional video evidence and witnesses. She's also worked directly with crime victims to ensure they get the support they need.</p>
					<p>Prior to joining the alderman’s office, Cat was Director of Outreach for Cook County Commissioner Bridget Degnen, where she worked with hundreds of constituents across the district to assist them in filing their own property tax appeals and applying for exemptions, saving or getting back thousands of dollars for some residents.</p>
					<p>Cat has also worked as an organizer on progressive Democratic campaigns, including Gov. JB Pritzker, and State Rep. Lindsey LaPointe, among others. In her spare time, Cat volunteers with Friends of the Chicago River as canoe guide, and is a leader with Chicago Conservation Corps.</p>
